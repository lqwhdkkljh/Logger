**A rework of this bot is ongoing, and hence you should not use this code to selfhost!**

Logger is a simple Discord bot for logging different events in your Discord server. It's coded in Node.js, using the discordie library to interact with the Discord API.

## Features

This bot currently supports setting a custom log channel on a per-server basis. When a log channel is set it will then log events to that channel.

**Current loggable events:**

| Event | Log type | Event name |
| ----- | -------- | ------------ |
| User joins server | Embed | `GUILD_MEMBER_ADD` |
| User leaves server | Embed | `GUILD_MEMBER_REMOVE` |
| User info is updated | Embed | `GUILD_MEMBER_UPDATE` |
| Emoji added/removed | Message | `GUILD_EMOJI_UPDATE` |
| User gets banned | Message | `GUILD_BAN_ADD` |
| User gets unbanned | Message | `GUILD_BAN_REMOVE` |
| User joins voice channel | Message | `VOICE_CHANNEL_JOIN` |
| User leaves voice channel | Message | `VOICE_CHANNEL_LEAVE` |
| Channel created | Message | `CHANNEL_CREATE` |
| Channel deleted | Message | `CHANNEL_DELETE` |
| Message is edited | Message | `MESSAGE_UPDATE` |
| Message is deleted | Message | `MESSAGE_DELETE` |
| Multiple messages are deleted | Message | `MESSAGE_DELETE_BULK` |

As a recent feature we've also introduced audit log integration for logging. This means that additional info for the events above is provided with each log entry.

**Please note:** We use Trello as our progress tracker, you can read what's going on with the bot here: https://trello.com/b/6hDyOJtL/logger
